## Post-Quantum Information System Security Lab
Professor Remi Chou leads the Post-Quantum Information System Security Lab. His research
focuses on post-quantum security and data privacy.  His research aims to build secure and
privacy-preserving communication protocols able to counter cyber threats such as denial of
service attacks, identity thefts, and data privacy breaches.  The results of his research help
secure emerging 6G communication networks, quantum communications networks, distributed data
storage systems, and data management systems.

### Potential Projects for Incoming SFS students at Professor Chou's Lab
Incoming SFS students will have the opportunity to participate in the projects listed below. 

#### Deep learning for distributed data storage​
The ubiquity of networked communication systems in our society raises ever-growing security and
privacy concerns. In particular, such concerns exist for applications that collect private user
information, as in health monitoring, e-commerce, and financial services, and applications
associated with critical infrastructures, such as transportation, smart grids, or process
supervisory management systems. This project aims to explore how deep learning can provide a
learning framework for distributed storage that avoids having a single point of failure and
hence losing private data in its entirety in the case of a security breach.

**Useful skills to have for this project:** Good knowledge of basic probability theory and a
programming language. Experience with Python and Tensorflow for deep learning is highly
desirable.

#### Deep learning for secret-key sharing in wireless networks​
The omnipresence of communication networks and the increasing number of connected users and devices
create challenges related to information security and data privacy. Most designs of current security
solutions are attack-specific and rely on the assumption of computationally limited opponents.
Consequently, systems constantly need to be updated to keep up with the increasing computational power
offered by computers, as well as, always more creative attacks from hackers. A paradigm called
information-theoretic security aims at obtaining security guarantees that hold for any possible strategy
of attack performed by an opponent with unlimited computational power. While several theoretical studies
support this paradigm, the development of practical implementations of information-theoretic secure
methods is still in its infancy. The goal of this project is the implementation of information-theoretic
methods via deep learning for secret-key generation.

**Useful skills to have for this project:** Good knowledge of basic probability theory and a
programming language. Experience with Python and Tensorflow for deep learning is highly
desirable. Knowledge of finite fields would be a plus.  


## Visual Computing and Biometrics Security Lab (VCBSL)
Professor Ajita Rattani leads the Visual Computing and Biometrics Security Lab (VCBSL). Her research

in security applications. Students in her lab employ several AI methods to design the
authentication systems, including machine learning, deep learning and adversarial pattern
classification.
